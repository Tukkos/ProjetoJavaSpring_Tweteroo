# ProjetoJavaSpring_Tweteroo

This repository is an API for an Twitter like app that can create new users, create tweets that user wants to post, get 5 tweets per page from the latest
and get all tweets from an user. This project has the purpose to apply my studies on Java, using Spring Boot as a framework.
